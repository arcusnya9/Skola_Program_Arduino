 60_second_stopWatch.ino
// Program is a modification of project 8 digital hourglass and has now become a 60 second stopwatch with an added green
// LED that blinks to user specification and instead of the tilt switch a real switch has been added
// that starts counting when the button is pressed and held for 50ms with the help of the ezButton Library.
// red led lights will also blink red while it's counting to 10 and when it has reached 10 it becomes non blinking and just
// becomes red until the end when the green LED will blink.


infinityTouchRecorder.ino
// program is based on project 13 with hardware modifications. It's using a piezo (speaker) instead of led light
// The program will logg all the sensor inputs into an array and when it's filled MAX_SIZE it replays the recording to the user
// for infinity.
